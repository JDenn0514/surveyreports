# Stage 3: Resolve Plan Issues + Log Decisions

## Before Starting

Check for a plan-review file at `plans/plan-review-{id}.md`.

**If the file exists:** Work through those issues in order. Do not do a fresh
review pass — the adversarial review is already done.

**If no file exists:** Tell the user:

> "No plan-review file found at `plans/plan-review-{id}.md`.
> Run Stage 2 first to get a saved issue list, then come back here to
> resolve them. Alternatively, confirm you want an informal review pass
> without a saved issue list."

---

## Choose a Batch Size

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

```
question: "How many issues do you want to see at a time?"
header: "Batch size"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "BIG — 4 issues at a time"
    description: "Present up to 4 issues, resolve all of them, then move to the next batch. Faster overall."
  - label: "SMALL — 1 issue at a time"
    description: "Present one issue, resolve it, then the next. Easier to stay focused."
```

Wait for the answer before presenting any issues.

---

## Working Through the Issues

Work through the issues **in the order they appear in the review file** —
do not re-group or re-sequence them.

**In BIG mode (4 at a time):** Show all issues in the batch as markdown text
first, then use `AskUserQuestion` for each issue in the batch sequentially.
Apply fixes after all decisions in the batch are collected. After applying each
fix, check whether it materially changes the framing of any remaining issues in
the batch — if so, re-present the affected issue with updated context. Then ask:
> "Ready for the next batch?"

**In SMALL mode (1 at a time):** Show the issue text, use `AskUserQuestion`,
apply the fix immediately, then move to the next issue.

Do not apply fixes speculatively — wait for the `AskUserQuestion` response on
each issue before editing the plan.

---

## Issue Format

Show each issue as markdown, then immediately use `AskUserQuestion`. The
recommended option **must be first**. Every option **must be labeled** with
the issue number and letter.

Present the issue text:

```
**Issue [N]: [Short title]**
Severity: BLOCKING | REQUIRED | SUGGESTION
[Rule violated, e.g. "Violates testing.md — missing numerical oracle criteria."]

[Concrete description, with section/plan reference.]

Options:
- **[A]** [Description] — Effort: [low/medium/high], Risk: [low/medium/high],
  Impact: [what this affects]
- **[B]** [Description]
- **[C] Do nothing** — [consequences of not addressing this]

**Recommendation: Option [A/B/C]** — [Why.]
```

Then call AskUserQuestion:

```
question: "Issue [N] — [Short title]: which option?"
header: "Issue [N]"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Issue [N] — Option [Rec]: [short label] (Recommended)"
    description: "[effort/risk/impact summary]"
  - label: "Issue [N] — Option [Alt]: [short label]"
    description: "[trade-offs]"
  - label: "Issue [N] — Option C: Do nothing"
    description: "[consequences]"
```

## Applying Fixes

When the user approves a direction, **edit the plan file immediately** — before
presenting the next issue. Do not batch fixes. After each edit, summarize what
changed in one sentence.

---

## Decisions Log

After all issues are resolved, write a decisions log entry if ANY of these
are true:

- You asked the user a question during this session
- You chose between meaningfully different approaches for PR scope or sequence
- You made a scope assumption not obvious from the spec or plan
- You deferred something to a later implementation

**If every decision is already fully captured in the updated plan, skip the
log entry.**

The log lives at `plans/decisions-{id}.md`. This file is **append-only** —
never overwrite or delete existing entries. If the file exists, add the new
entry below all previous entries. Create the file with this header only if
it doesn't exist yet:

```markdown
# Decisions Log — surveyreports [id]

This file records planning decisions made during [id].
Each entry corresponds to one planning session.

---
```

Entry format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Component or feature planned]

### Context

[1–2 sentences: what were we trying to figure out in this session?]

### Questions & Decisions

**Q: [The question that came up]**
- Options considered:
  - **[Option A]:** [description and trade-offs]
  - **[Option B]:** [description and trade-offs]
- **Decision:** [what was decided]
- **Rationale:** [why — mapped to project constraints and engineering preferences]

### Outcome

[1 sentence: what will be built as a result of this session]

---
```

Only log decisions — not implementation details already determined by the plan
or a rule file.

---

## After Resolution

Tell the user:

> "The plan is approved. Hand off to `/r-implement` and start with PR 1
> in the PR map."
