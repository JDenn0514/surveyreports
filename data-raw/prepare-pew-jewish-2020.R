## Output dataset: pew_jewish_2020
##   5,881 respondents (adults who completed the extended survey)
##   Design: Jackknife replication (EXTWEIGHT / EXTWEIGHT1–EXTWEIGHT100)

##
## Key mapping (SCREAMING_SNAKE → lower_snake_case):

##   REGION → region | SEXASK → sexask | AGE4CAT → age4cat
##   EDUC4CAT → educ4cat | RELIGMOD → religmod | HISP → hisp
##   RACECMB → racecmb | RACETHN → racethn
##   RELCONSIDER_A → relconsider_a | (all RELCONSIDER_* follow same pattern)
##   RELRAISED_A → relraised_a
##   PRESAPP → presapp | TRACK → track
##   DISCRIM_A → discrim_a | (all DISCRIM_* follow same pattern)
##   EXTWEIGHT → extweight | EXTWEIGHT1 → extweight1 ... EXTWEIGHT100 → extweight100

##   "Please tell us how much discrimination there is against each of
##    these groups in our society today."
