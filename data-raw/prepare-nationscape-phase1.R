## Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape — Phase 1 (Waves 1–24)
## Prepare survey data with cleaned metadata

## URL: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data/nationscape
## License: Academic research use; see data-raw/nationscape/ for user guide.
##
## Phase 1 coverage: July 18, 2019 – December 26, 2019 (24 weekly waves)
## Waves: ns20190718 through ns20191226
## Sample: ~6,250 completed interviews per wave (~150,000 total)
## Mode: Online (Lucid respondent exchange platform)
## Design: Non-probability quota sample with raking weights
##   Weight variable: weight (calibrated to ACS + 2016 vote targets)
##   No cluster or strata variables
##
## Output: A named list `ns_phase1` with one entry per wave (each is a
##   data frame with cleaned metadata). Each list entry is named by wave ID.
##
## On variance estimation:
##   The Nationscape is a calibrated non-probability sample. Use
##   as_survey_nonprob(data, weights = weight) — designed for exactly this
##   use case. Current variance uses a conservative SRS approximation
##   (Rivers & Bailey 2009); bootstrap re-calibration variance (Deville &
##   Sarndal 1992) will be available in Phase 2.5 via surveywts.

## Bundle the first wave (ns20190718, July 18, 2019) as `ns_wave1` for use
## in package examples, vignettes, and tests. Only one wave is bundled
## because 24 waves × ~6,250 rows would be too large for a CRAN package.
## For cross-wave analysis, use saveRDS() locally (see usage notes below).

## ---- Survey design and usage notes ----
##
## To create a survey design for a single wave:
##
##   wave1 <- ns_phase1[["ns20190718"]]
##   d <- as_survey_nonprob(wave1, weights = weight)
##   get_freqs(d, pres_approval)
##
## To combine all Phase 1 waves for cross-wave analysis:
##
##   phase1_combined <- dplyr::bind_rows(ns_phase1)
##   d_all <- as_survey_nonprob(phase1_combined, weights = weight)
##
## NOTE: When combining waves, variables not asked in a given wave are NA.
## Use Nationscape-Variables-2021Dec.csv to identify which variables are
## present in each wave before combining.
##
## Save the processed data locally for reuse:
##
##   saveRDS(ns_phase1, "data-raw/nationscape/ns_phase1.rds")
